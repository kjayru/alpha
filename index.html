    <h1>Barot Bellingham</h1>
    <p>Barot can trace his decision to become an artist to the ripe old age of two, when his mother put his first crayon painting on the refrigerator. From that point on, he was obsessed with art, and began creating mature works of art as early as five years old. A child prodigy, Barot sold his first professional painting at the age of nine for $2000, and was guest lecturing on art by the time he was eleven.</p>

    <h1>Constance Olivia Smith</h1>
    <p>Constance received the Fullerton-Brighton-Norwell Award for Modern Art for her mixed-media image of a tree of life, with jewel-adorned branches depicting the arms of humanity, and precious gemstone-decorated leaves representing the spouting buds of togetherness. The daughter of a New York jeweler, Constance has been salvaging the discarded remnants of her father's jewelry-making since she was five years old, and won the New York State Fair grand prize at the age of 8 years old for a gem-adorned painting of the Manhattan Bridge.</p>

    <h1>Gerard Kent Donahue</h1>
    <p>Art is in Gerard's genes. His father, Maston Gerard Donahue was a sculptor who helped create some of the most notable statues of our time, including the "Windmill of Time" in Washington, D.C. His mother Lillian Paxton Donahue, is a landscape painter who supported the family full-time by the sale of her paintings, after the untimely death of Gerard's father when Gerard was just 13. Gerard learned the early lessons in sculpting from his father, and continues to study sculpture as his life's passion, partially to complete the legacy of his father, and partially to forge this own destiny as an accomplished sculptor. He is currently the Renton Scholar at Deschton University in Vienna Austria, and is completing his artist in residence commitment for the next year.</p>

    <h1>Hassum Harrod</h1>
    <p>The Art College in New Dehli sponsored Hassum on scholarship for his entire undergraduate career at the university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted and vibrant tones, and are almost a contradiction in art. Expected to follow in his grandfather's and father's footsteps and become an engineer, Hassum followed his heart and never looked back. Currently, Hassum is studying for his MFA at San Francisco Art Academy, where he has become known for his impressive color theories and one-of-a-kind color palettes – and has amassed an extensive underground following.</p>
